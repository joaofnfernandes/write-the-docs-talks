I'm an Academy Engineer at OutSystems (www.outsystems.com).

The Academy team is a 5-person team that works inside OutSystems's 60-person R&D, and is responsible for creating and maintaining all resources necessary to learn the OutSystems Platform.

We're responsible for creating:
- Online training;
- Documentation for the product;
- API/SDK documentation;
- Technical Notes;
- Certification Exams.

And we work closely with the development teams to:
 - Decrease the time it takes to learn our platform;
 - Review APIs to ensure they're easy to use;
 - Review UI copy that goes into the product.

My team has an interesting approach to documentation, that I haven't seen on many companies. Our ultimate goal is:
"Make our users proficient with the OutSystems Platform in 0 seconds"

This means that we are constantly striving to put ourselves out of a job, since reading the docs will take our users more than zero seconds :)
