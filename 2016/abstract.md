A new model for tech writing teams


The more I compare design and tech writing, the more I understand the similarities of these two fields.

No so long ago, designers were constantly frustrated for not being a part of the development cycle.

Management and developers would see designers as extraneous to the development process. As such, designers would only join the project at the last minute. By then, there wasn't enough time backtrack from some of the decisions made early on the project.

Designers were being called at the last minute, with the hopes that they could save a pig by tactically applying some lipstick.

Of course not all teams are alike. During the 80s and 90s some pioneering teams were already including designers in the development cycle.

But the great majority of teams took some time to understand the benefits of including the design team in the product cycle. I think the tipping point was around 2010.

Now, it's clear to almost everyone that you can't have great products without getting designers involved early on.

What changed?

A ton has changed, but one thing that you don't see mentioned often is that companies started changing the way they measure the value of their design teams.

Before, companies measured that the value of their design teams by their deliverables. Mock-ups, illustrations, and assets.

Companies did this, because measuring the number of assets a designer made, is easy. But we now know that designers bring more to the table than just deliverables.

A huge part of their value, is on how they frame the product discussion. They bring sanity, and focus the discussions around the users and their experience with the product.

Now we understand that all the small decisions we make on the product, have an impact on the user experience.
That's why the design team can't have a meaningful impact on the project, if they are late to these discussions.


Interestingly, the tech writing field hasn't gone through the same transition. Not yet.


From what I can see, most companies still measure the value of their tech writing teams by their deliverables. And for tech writing teams their deliverables are words, paragraphs, or doc pages.

But for me this has two problems:

- If you only measure deliverables, then more will always be better. More words, more paragraphs, more doc pages. And I'm not completly sure that a product with 5k doc pages is better than other that has just 5 pages. It's just not that linear.
- If you only measure deliverables, then I agree that it makes no sense to include tech writers as part of the development cycle. After all, their deliverables depend on the product being stable and ready to ship.

So what value can tech writers deliver, that earns them a place at the product development cycle?

In this talk, I'll tell you what we're doing at Docker to win our place at the table.
I'll tell you how we organized our team to be more effective, and the processes we use to ensure we still work as a team.

I'll also share some of our war stories and what we've learned from them.
