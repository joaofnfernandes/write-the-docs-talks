7 values of effective tech writing teams

Not so long ago, designers were not part of the product development cycle.
They were only called at the last minute, with the hopes they
could help salvage the project. But by then they couldn't do much, since it's
hard to backtrack from bad design decisions made early on.

Fortunately this has changed. Both management and developers now see
the value of including designers as part of the development cycle.

The same has to happen with tech writers!
 
In this talk I'll share with you the 7 core values my tech writing team used
at OutSystems, where we changed the company culture and won our place in the
development cycle.

These values are also being useful to me at Docker, where I'm still learning
about the product, the users, and the best way to ship documentation.
