Hi!

My name is Joao, and I'm a Technical Writer at Docker.

For the ones of you that don't know Docker, we're
creating a platform to make the internet programable.
With Docker you can build, ship, and run your apps anywhere.
That can be on your computer, on the cloud, on a windows or
a linux. It really doesn't matter.

And today I'll talk about 7 values that I try to follow as a
technical writer and as a person.

But before I jump and start explaining these 7 rules, I need to
say that I'm kind of sceptic when someone tries to sell me a book
or a talk that essentially says:

"If you do this N things, you'll be successful"

If you don't know what kinds of books and talks I'm
talking about, they can be

> 7 habits of highly effective people,

> 8 secrets of success

or even 

> 7 values of effective tech writing teams.

I'm sceptic, and you should be too. It's not that I don't believe
the authors and what they're saying. It's because success and
effectiveness are words without any meaning. Success and
effectiveness only have meaning when you have goals, and make
progress towards those goals.

A goal can be:

- money
- time
- influence

Progress are the steps you're taking to achieve those goals.

So before I talk about the 7 values of effective technical writing
teams, I need to explain you:

- What are the goals of successful tech writing teams
- The steps they take to reach those goals


I might sound heretic when I say this, but I would argue that
successful tech writing teams only have one goal.
They ask themselves

> "Am I putting myself out of work?"

And by this I don't mean 

> "Am I so bad at this, that I might get fired today?"

I mean:

> "Am I working to improve the product and processes, so that my 
users can use the product with less or no documentation?"


And the steps they take to achieve those goals are not
secret. They don't have any silver bullets.

So usually, they create progress by telling themselves

> "There are no secrets. Let's sit our asses down and do some work"

I know it's kind of obvious. But instead of just freezing they
start working. Sometimes they make right decisions, and 
sometimes they make wrong decisions.

The important thing is that they keep moving towards to goal.


Now that you know the goal of a effective tech writing team,
and how they make progress, I can share with you

the 7 values of effective tech writing teams.

---

The values are:

- Be the CEO (of the docs)
- Ask why
- 80/20
- Be proactive
- Small crisis
- Communication
- Help and coach others - complain that they're doing wrong


## Be the CEO (of the docs)

Usually when I ask tech writers what do you need to do
to become a great tech writer, the most common answer I get
is:

> "Know your audience"

But I would argue that "knowing your audience" only makes you a good
tech writer. It doesn't make you a great one.

Your audience is only a small piece of the whole puzzle.

Great tech writers know:

- The market
- The product
- The users

If you don't understand the market, you won't be able to understand
what pain points your company is trying to solve.
And if you don't understand the pain points, you won't be able
to create documentation that empowers users. Instead, you'll be
creating documentation about screens and features.

If you don't understand the product, you won't be able to explain
others how to use it. You will either:

 - Create complex explanations because you can't understand what
 is essential, and what is extraneous
 - Create documentation for things the user can learn just by
 looking at the UI.

If you don't understand your users, you'll be creating something
for you, not for them.

If know you the market, the product, and the users, you'll know how
to prioritize your work, and have more than gut feelings to
support your arguments when discussing decisions with engineers,
product managers, and support.


## Ask why

Great tech writers know that everyone communicates solutions
instead of stating the problem they have.
So they develop an habit of asking why, until they understand
the root cause of a problem, and then work on tackling the problem
by its root.


Developers tell you that you need to write something about how
to install the product with a special option.

Product managers tell you that you need to make the installation
instructions sound simpler.

Support gives you five disclaimers you need to add to the installation
docs.

No one tells you why, but all of them tell that it needs to
be done fast.

If you never ask why, you will end up:

- With documentation that is impossible to maintain. No one ever asks
you to remove documentation, they always ask to add more.
- With documentation that is cluttered and not meaningfull for most of
your users.
- Putting out fires all day long, and never have time to do
strategic work



## Be proactive

Great tech writers are proactive and don't wait to be told what
to do.

They don't care about titles or job descriptions. They know their
goal is putting themselves out of work, so they drive the development
teams into making products that require less training and
documentation.

Of course finding excuses is easy:

- Management won't let me
- The development team ignores me
- Other companies have more resources than I have
- I'm only called into the project at the last minute
- That isn't my job description

And I know that some of you are thinking that these aren't
excuses at all. You might be thinking that this is the reality
at your company, and there's nothing you can do to change that.

But I don't think that's the case, and let me explain you why.

Not so long ago, designers were also telling themselves:

- Management won't let me
- The development team ignores me
- Other companies have more resources than I have
- I'm only called into the project at the last minute

The only excuse you didn't hear from them was

> That's not my job description.

They were proactive, and did not wait to be told what to do. At every
opportunity, they helped improve the product, no matter if it was
their job description or not.

And look where they are now:

- Management listens to them
- The development teams listens to them
- The budget for design teams has increased
- They are in the product development cycle

So I see no reason for the same not to happen with tech writers.


## 80/20

Great tech writers don't try to document every feature, every
screen, and every button to exhaustion.

They apply the 80/20 rule. They try to document the things 80%
of customers care about.

They know that:

- The product is constantly changing, 
- Whatever they write now, they'll have to maintain in the years to come
- You should not document things that you can learn just by looking
at the UI

They take no pride in writing things that no one ever reads. Instead,
they collect metrics, and use them to iterate or delete docs that
users don't read.


## Communication

Great tech writers know that writing is just a way to transfer
ideas from one head to another. They care about transfering
ideas and knowledge in an effective way.

They see writing as only a tool, and know that hey have other tools
they can use like pictures, diagrams, code snippets, videos,
interactive explorations, and others.

They also know that writing, as any other tool, can be
tweaked and hacked, to be improved for a given purpose.

This last point is very relevant. Great technical writers don't
mind going against grammatical conventions, if that makes it easier
to transfer ideas.

But don't take my word for it, after all I don't even speak
english correctly.

Take Shakespeare as an example. That guy really didn't mind
breaking conventions and good practices. And in the process
of assassinating grammatical correctness he ended up creating
a ton of new words that we all use today.


## Helping and coaching others

Great technical writers don't waste time complaining that
developers can't write.

They know they are just one, for 15+ developers. So they try
levaraging developers instead of trying to fight them.

They create collateral, FAQs, presentations, brownbag sessions that
can be leveraged by the rest of the company. They brainstorm
side-by-side with developers to improve their proposals.
