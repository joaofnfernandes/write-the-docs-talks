Hi!

My name is Joao, and I'm a Technical Writer at Docker.

For the ones of you that don't know Docker, we're
creating a platform to make the internet programable.
With Docker you can build, ship, and run your apps anywhere.
That can be on your computer, on the cloud, on a windows or
a linux. It really doesn't matter.

And today I'll talk about 7 values that I try to follow as a
technical writer and as a person.

But before I jump and start explaining these 7 rules, I need to
say that I'm kind of sceptic when someone tries to sell me a book
or a talk that essentially says:

"If you do this N things, you'll be successful"

If you don't know what kinds of books and talks I'm
talking about, they can be
7 habits of highly effective people,

8 secrets of success

or even 7 values of effective tech writing teams.

I'm sceptic, and you should be too. Its not that I don't believe
the authors, its that what they're saying is that
you could take someone at random, make them follow whatever N
rules they write about, and that person would instantly
become successful.

We all know that it just doesn't work like that. I know it, and
you know it.

It doesn't work like that for two reasons:

- Success is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. So what's keeping
us from becoming succesful are not 7 or 8 secrets
What's keeping us from being successful are the 99% of perspiration.

- Success is a word with no meaning. Success only has a meaning
when you're comparing yourself against some set of metrics.

The metrics can be:
- money
- time
- influence
- fame

or something else.

So before I talk about the 7 values of effective technical writing
teams, I need to explain you:

- How to do the 99% perspiration part. This talk will hopefully
give you the 1% of inspiration.
- What are the metrics I use to evaluate the sucess of a tech
team.

The answer to the first is easy, but you might not like the
answer I've got for you.

My answer is
"There are no shortcuts, sit you ass down and work."

I know it's kind of obvious, but it's true. There is no way
around this.

So when you're at work scrolling your Twitter feed, and trying
to convince yourself that you're gathering user feedback, stop it,
sit your ass down, and work!

When you arrive late, and plan on leaving early, sit your ass
down and work!

And when you feel you need a bathroom break...
Maybe you should take it. You don't want to get a urinary
infection.

But you get the idea.

Now on to the metrics I use to evaluate the success of a tech writing
team. This is hard because the metrics I choose to
define success might be different than the ones you choose.

In my case, I use a single metric to define success. I might
sound heretic, but the question I ask myself is

"Am I putting myself out of work?"

And by this I don't mean 
"Am I so bad at this, that I might get fired today?"

I mean:

"Am I working to improve the product and processes, so that my 
users can use the product with less or no documentation?"

Just to give you a more concrete example, a few days ago I
wrote a tutorial on how to deploy an app using Docker. And
the question I had on the back of my mind was

"Am I working to improve our product and processes so that
someday I can delete that tutorial, knowing that users will be
able to deploy apps without needing to read it?"


Now that you know my definition of success, you can share with
you the 7 values I think any effective tech writing team
should follow.

------

The values are:

- Be the CEO
- Ask why - challenge yourself and others
- 80/20
- Proactivity - define their metrics
- Small crisis - only solving tactical problems
- Communication
- Help and coach others - complain that they're doing wrong

If you ask good tech writers about what they value most, usually
they tell you that you need to

"Know your audience"

But I would argue that "knowing your audience" only makes you a good
tech writer. I doesn't make you a great one.

Your audience is only a small piece of the whole puzzle.

Great tech writers know:
- The market
- The product
- The users

If you don't understand the market, you won't be able to understand
what pain points your company is trying to solve.
And if you don't understand the pain points, you won't be able
to create documentation that empowers users. Instead, you'll be
creating documentation for screens and features.

If you don't understand the product, you won't be able to explain
others how to use it. You will either:
 - Create complex explanations because you can't understand what
 is essential, and what is extraneous
 - Create documentation for things the user can learn just by
 looking at the UI.

If you don't understand your users, you'll be creating something
for you, not for them.

If you the market, the product, and the users, you'll know how
to prioritize your work, and have more than gut feelings to
support your arguments when discussing decisions with engineers,
product managers, and support.

Great tech writers are proactive and don't wait to be told what
to do.

They don't care about titles or job descriptions. They know their
goal is putting themselves out of work, so they drive the development
teams into making products that require less training and
documentation.

Of course finding excuses is easy:

- Management won't let me
- The development team ignores me
- Other companies have more resources than I have
- I'm only called into the project at the last minute
- That isn't my job description

And I know that some of you are thinking that these aren't
excuses. This is the reality at your company, and there's
nothing you can do to change that.

But I don't think that's the case, and let me explain you why.

Not so long ago, designers were also telling themselves:
- Management won't let me
- The development team ignores me
- Other companies have more resources than I have
- I'm only called into the project at the last minute

The only excuse you didn't hear from that was
- That isn't my job description.

They were proactive, and didn't to be told what to do. At every
opportunity, they helped improve the product, no matter if it was
their job description or not.

And look where they are now:
- Management listens to them
- The development teams listens to them
- The budget for design teams has increased
- They are in the product development cycle

So I see no reason for the same not to happen with tech writers.
